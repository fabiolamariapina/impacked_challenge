# Assumptions
1. The data in the JSON file can be updated at any time

# Steps I wanted to take
1. download json file
2. use fetch to retrieve data and create functions

# Problems I ran into
1. My own repository would not clone with HTTPS or SSH key methods. I spent the first 30 minutes of the assessment trying to resolve this issue. My solution was to use Github desktop, which I was new for me.
2. The majority of my time trying to complete this assessment was trying to figure out why fetch was not working in retrieving the JSON data.
